In this fun and breezy talk, we'll take a tour of all those capabilities we run into but don't quite know what they do, those "sc.variable", "ref" and "hint" attributes, environment variables, dependency injection and the Factory. For each feature, we'll show the syntax, why it's there, and how you can use it. You'll see ShowConfig in a whole new light after this session.
